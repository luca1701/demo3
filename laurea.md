Issues with git-flow

I travel all over the place teaching Git to people and nearly every class and workshop I’ve done recently has asked me what I think about git-flow. I always answer that I think that it’s great - it has taken a system (Git) that has a million possible workflows and documented a well tested, flexible workflow that works for lots of developers in a fairly straightforward manner. It has become something of a standard so that developers can move between projects or companies and be familiar with this standardized workflow.

However, it does have its issues. I have heard a number of opinions from people along the lines of not liking that new feature branches are started off of develop rather than master, or the way it handles hotfixes, but those are fairly minor.
